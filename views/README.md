# Views

Sinatra is built upon a very powerful templating engine, [Tilt][tilt].

This enables you to do all sorts of fun and exciting things to display your
views. In this section we will cover some of them, along with the
[book][views-book].

Also, be sure to read up the [readme][views-readme] first to cover the basics of
what's possible within Sinatra itself and for a list of supported templates
inherited from Tilt.
