# Models

Models are a common pattern for abstracting your data out into an
Object-relational mapper or other low-level interface for data transport. This
section will cover recipes for integrating these into your Sinatra
application. The suggested practice for this is using
[datamapper][datamapper], which is covered in the [book][models].
